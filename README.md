Bellow there is a snick peak of the front end in action. The questions are sent to the backend through node REST API, then the backend make the AI API request and sends the answer to the frontend.

## Project Structure<br>

It's a good practice in a frontend project to make components that could be used more often, separated components. So the project has a folder that stores all the  application's components. In large projects is good to separate the interfaces used to type the variables in one single place, then I made it too as well I separated the API connection config into its own folder too.<br>
